Find Your Next Neighborhood

An average american moves 11.4 times in their lifetime, according to U.S. Census bureau. In the case of cross country relocations, people sometimes have little knowledge about the new residence and its surroundings. Some might prefer neighborhoods with young families and entertainment, some -- more established neighborhoods, where the majority of residents have paid off their houses. 

This project serves to mitigate the problem of moving into an uncomfortable neighborhood. Using data from foursquare and city-data neighborhoods similar to the client's current neighborhood can be found and reccomended.
